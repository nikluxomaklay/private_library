# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement filtering functionality for 6 different list pages (Reading log, Authors, Books, Book editions, Publishers, Book series) using django-filter for advanced filtering capabilities. The solution will include date selectors for year/month filtering, search inputs for text-based filtering with partial matching, and exact match filters where required. All filter inputs will maintain the same styling as existing content addition pages. The implementation will follow Django best practices and use django-autocomplete-light for dynamic selectors where needed.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, Django 4.x
**Primary Dependencies**: django, django-bootstrap5, django-autocomplete-light, django-filter (existing project dependencies)
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (existing project database)
**Testing**: pytest, django testing framework
**Target Platform**: Linux server (web application)
**Project Type**: Web application (single project with Django backend and templates)
**Performance Goals**: <2 seconds response time for filter operations (as specified in success criteria)
**Constraints**: Must use only current project dependencies including django-filter, no other new dependencies allowed; filter inputs must match styling of existing content addition pages
**Scale/Scope**: Anonymous users accessing filter functionality across 6 different list pages

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Model-First**: PASS - Will extend existing models with filtering capabilities
- **Admin Interface**: PASS - Existing admin interface will support filtering
- **Test-First**: PASS - Will implement TDD approach with pytest
- **Integration Testing**: PASS - Will test filter functionality across different pages
- **Observability**: PASS - Will implement structured logging for filter operations
- **Dependency Constraint**: PASS - Will use only existing project dependencies including django-filter as required
- **Documentation**: PASS - Will document in Russian following Google Docstring style

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
